# Firebase Security Rule Pitfalls: PERMISSION_DENIED Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Firebase Realtime Database security rules where the `PERMISSION_DENIED` error occurs even when the rules appear correct at first glance. The problem often stems from subtle issues related to:

* **Rule ordering**
* **Data structure discrepancies**
* **Client-side time synchronization**
* **Asynchronous operations**

The `firebaseBug.js` file shows code exhibiting the issue. The `firebaseBugSolution.js` contains the corrected implementation with solutions and detailed explanations.  This demonstrates several best practices for debugging and writing secure Firebase rules.
