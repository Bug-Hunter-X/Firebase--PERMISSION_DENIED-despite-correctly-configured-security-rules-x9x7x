To resolve `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors, carefully review your security rules, ensuring:

1. **Accurate Timestamps:** Use server-side timestamps (`firebase.database.ServerValue.TIMESTAMP`) instead of client-side timestamps to avoid clock synchronization issues.

2. **Precise Data Structure Matching:** Verify that your rules exactly match your application's data structure, down to the path and property names. 

3. **Correct Rule Order:** Place less restrictive rules *after* more restrictive rules. This ensures that the proper rules get evaluated.

4. **Avoid Asynchronous Calls in Rules:**  Security rules should be synchronous.  Don't rely on data loaded asynchronously within the rule itself.

5. **Explicit Permissions:**  Ensure you explicitly grant access for all necessary operations; implicit denials are common.

6. **Emulator Testing:**  Thoroughly test your rules using the Firebase Emulator Suite to simulate real-world conditions.

**Example (Corrected Rule Order):**

```javascript
'.write': true, // Less restrictive rule
'.write': 'auth.uid === newData.uid' // More restrictive rule (now correctly functions)
```

By addressing these points, you can significantly reduce the occurrence of unexpected `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors in your Firebase application.
